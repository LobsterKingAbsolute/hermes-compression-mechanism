        Two modes:

        * ``/compress [<focus>]`` — compress the *whole* history. An
          optional focus topic guides the summariser to preserve
          information related to *focus* while being more aggressive
          about discarding everything else.  Inspired by Claude Code's
          ``/compact <focus>`` feature.
        * ``/compress here [N]`` — boundary-aware compression. Summarize
          everything *except* the most recent ``N`` exchanges (default
          2), which are preserved verbatim. Inspired by Claude Code's
          Rewind "Summarize up to here" action (v2.1.139, May 2026,
          https://code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new/2026-w20). Lets the
          user pick the compression boundary instead of leaving it to
          the automatic token-budget heuristic.
